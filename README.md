#### Topics
- Introduction to Version Control with Git.
- Basic Git commands: clone, add, commit, push, pull, branch, merge.
- Setting up and using a GitHub account for project management and collaboration.
- Command Line Interface (CLI) basics and its role in software development.
- Essential CLI commands for navigating directories, managing files, and using Git.

#### Learning Goals
By the end of this week, students should be able to:
- [ ] Understand the concept of version control and the importance of Git in software development.
- [ ] Perform basic Git operations to manage version control in their projects.
- [ ] Use GitHub for hosting code repositories and collaborating with others.
- [ ] Navigate and execute basic tasks in the Command Line Interface.
- [ ] Apply CLI commands to work with Git and manage code versions efficiently.

#### Homework: Documenting CLI Commands with Git

- **Objective**: Utilize Git and command line interfaces (CLI) to document and version-control a series of CLI commands.
- **Step-by-Step Guide**:
  - Initialize a new Git repository on your local machine for this project.
  - Create a file named `README.md` in your repository. This file will serve as the main document for this assignment.
  - Write about a CLI command you've learned this week in the `README.md` file. Describe what the command does and provide an example of its usage.
  - After writing about the command, commit the changes to your Git repository with a descriptive commit message that reflects the additions.
  - Push the commit to a remote repository on a platform like GitHub after each command is documented.
  - Repeat this process for a total of five CLI commands, ensuring each command is committed and pushed separately.
- **Deliverables**: 
  - A `README.md` file in your repository that documents five CLI commands learned during the week.
  - A series of at least five commits showing the incremental documentation of each CLI command.
  - A link to the remote repository showcasing the final project with all commits and the push history.
#### Glossary of Key Terms
- **Git**: A distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development.
- **GitHub**: A web-based hosting service for version control using Git, offering collaboration features like bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.
- **Command Line Interface (CLI)**: A text-based interface used to interact with software and operating systems by typing commands into a console.
- **Version Control**: The practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
- **Repository (Repo)**: A directory where Git stores the history of changes to your project files.
